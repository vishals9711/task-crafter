CURSOR RULES

Holistic understanding of requirements & stack
Prioritize smooth animations, modern typography, and glassmorphic effects
Use vibrant gradients and playful interactions

TECHNOLOGY STACK

Frontend:
- Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript
- UI Components: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Icons: Lucide React
- Animations: Framer Motion (optional, confirm before use)
- Package Manager: pnpm (default)

Backend:
- API Routes: Next.js API Routes
- Language: TypeScript

LLM Integration:
- API endpoint to connect frontend with backend (if needed in future phases)

Deployment:
- GCP Cloud Run (if server-side required)
- Vercel (preferred for frontend-only deployment)

CODING STYLE

Code must start with path/filename as a one-line comment
Prioritize modularity, reusability, and clean architecture
Comments should explain purpose, with effect noted when necessary
Animations should be subtle, smooth, and performance-optimized

CODING PROCESS

Step-by-step code delivery
Finish one file before the next
If code is incomplete, add TODO: comments
Use minimal external libraries unless approved

EDITING CODE

Return full edited files
Prioritize modular, DRY, and performance-optimized code

VERBOSITY

V=0: Code golf (shortest, minimal comments)
V=1: Concise (minimal comments, DRY focus)
V=2: Simple (balanced comments, modular design)
V=3: Verbose (detailed comments, extracted functions, highest modularity)
